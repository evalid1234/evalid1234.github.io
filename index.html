                projects as well
                as what I have learned. I am currently a senior at FIU ( Florida International University ) who is majoring in
                Computer Science, with a minor in mathematics and a big interest in web based development. I Like working out, learning, and generally just having a good time. I offer tutoring for college related courses and have worked for FIU for some time as a learning assistant.

                        In my time at FIU I have had to make a variety of projects as well as some of my own. Some pretty rough around the
                        edges but that was part of my learning process. This list will be updated soon as I 
                        am transfering old projects:

                                given to design, evaluation, and implementation. Programs are written in a few
                                languages.

                                <li><b>In class: </b>We often discussed the theory of programming languages and the creation of new technologies as well as paradigms
                                (imperative vs declarative) over time. We also had to create basic language syntaxes whether in code or by hand(creating
                                a CFG) using the fundamentals required in language creation. In terms of work, we created various programs in f# to go
                                over declarative programming paradigms.</li>

                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>
                Communication of central ideas was the most important aspect of my job. 
                I had to adjust my communication style for every
                individual. Many were reserved and required a more nuanced and non-stimulative approach to conversation. Others loved to
                chat and were most engaged with high levels of energy and friendly rapport building mixed into our sessions.
                Regardless, I had to learn to approach each individual in a way that was conducive to their learning style.

                <h3>Flexibility and learning</h3>
                <p>
                Additionally, the most challenging part of my job is having to relearn/rethink central ideas. Often, the way I learned
                was far from the way others would learn. This required me to relearn or rewire my brain during a session
                to re-express an idea. Examples of this often came with abstract structures or operating Systems concepts like threading
                and processes. If the examples I made didn't work, I
                would just need to rethink an example, or even find a different approach on the fly. Many times, I would often spend time outside of sessions to learn different ways of understanding upcoming topics.

                <h3>Responsibility</h3>
                <p>
                    My time tutoring has also instilled a sense of responsibility and proactivity in me. This was because I was not micro-managed and was trusted to run myself, my tutees, and my job responsibilities/sessions on my own. This included me:
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating my own schedule/hours </li>
                    <li>Reporting/creating my own time sheets</li>
                    <li>Seeking out and completing supplemental training on my own</li>
                    <li>Abiding by the institutions rules and regulations</li>
                    <li>Conducting myslef appropriately to the standards of the instituiton and its handbook</li>
                    <li>Addressing my own problems and reach out to the proper channels when necessary.</li>
                    <li>Participating in weekly meetings</li>
                </ul>
                This has required me to be diligent in maintaining my work/life balance, keeping myself accountable, and keeping myself disciplined. Ultimately, I find it is safe to say working for FIU has made me a more efficient and responsible person.
