					<h2>Tutoring Experience</h2>

					<div>
						<h3>What I have learned: </h3>
						<span id="tutoring_dots"><b>...</b></span>
						<span class="more" id="tutoring_more">
							<h4>Communication and Cooperation</h4>
						<p>
							<span id="tutoring_dots"><b>...</b></span>
							<p class="more" id="tutoring_more">
							<span style="text-align: left;">
								Communication of central ideas was the most important aspect of my job. 
								I had to adjust my communication style for every
								individual. Many were reserved and required a more nuanced and non-stimulative approach to conversation. Others loved to
								chat and were most engaged with high levels of energy and friendly rapport building mixed into our tutoring sessions.
								Regardless, I had to learn to approach each individual in a way that was conducive to learning. I also had to work with
								individuals with learning disabilities and had to learn how to reliably get information to stick. Cooperation was also
								necessary as I needed to conduct sessions based on individuals' needs and how they learn best. Many required high-level
								images and step-by-step illustrations, others required mnemonic devices or visual cues to remember or digest
								information. I had to learn about every individual and cater to their needs!
							</span>
							<br>

							<h4>Flexibility in learning</h4> 

							<span style="text-align: left;">
								Additionally, the most challenging part of my job is having to relearn/rethink central ideas. Often, the way I learned
								was far from the way others would learn, which required that I would need to relearn or rewire my brain during a session
								to re-express an idea. Examples of this often came with abstract structures or operating Systems concepts like threading
								and processes. Often people didn't like the textbook definition of threading: <b><i>Threading is a lightweight process
										that executes code sequence and all the data supporting structures such as opened resources, memory
										map, stack, etc..</i></b>, while reading this makes practical sense to me( I like to read the documentation and
								formal definitions as they often have information that makes concepts click in my head), often I found this did NOT make
								any real sense to most people. Often I found making references to the real world to work the best. This would require I
								think of formal definitions in a practical or simplified way. One such idea for threads is having a restaurant with one
								worker ( single thread) handling one job, if the thread is busy computing something ( like cutting vegetables or
								something else) you have no choice but to wait for the worker to finish to move to the next task. Of course, as a
								restaurant owner, you would find this inefficient and decide you should hire some workers. so, instead of waiting, you
								now have multiple workers ( multiple threads ) that can carry out other tasks ( cooking, washing dishes, etc..). While a
								relatively rough description, the core idea, and rationale become quite apparent to most. If the example didn't work, I
								would just need to rethink an example, or even find a different approach! It was hard, but one of the most rewarding
								aspects of tutoring is when it finally clicks for someone.
								</span>

								<h4>Responsibility</h4>
								<span style="text-align: left;">
									My time tutoring has also instilled a sense of responsibility and proactivity in me. This was because I was not
									micro-managed and was trusted to run myself, my tutees, and my job responsibilities/sessions on my own. This included
									me:
								</span>
									<ul style="text-align: left;"> 
										<li>Creating my own schedule/hours </li>
										<li>Reporting/creating my own time sheets</li> 
										<li>Seeking out and completing supplemental training on my own</li> 
										<li>Abiding by the institutions rules and regulations</li>
										<li>Conducting myslef appropriately to the standards of the instituiton and its handbook</li>
										<li>Addressing my own problems and reach out to the proper channels when necessary.</li>
										<li>Participating in weekly meetings</li>
									</ul>
								<span style="text-align: left;">
								This has required me to be diligent in maintaining my work/life balance, keeping myself accountable, and keeping myself
								disciplined. Ultimately, I find it is safe to say working for FIU has made me a more efficient and responsible person.
